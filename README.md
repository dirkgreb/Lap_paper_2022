# Supplementary files and code to produce HMM logos  

A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the code and process used to generate HMM logos in Figure 5 and Figure S4 is found in `Sequence_logos/`.  

Intermediate FASTA files used in other analysis (conservation mapping in ChimeraX, sequence alignments) are stored by Figure in `Sequence_alns_list`.
